                    <p>Yumthang Valley, Zero Point - Yumthang valley: The name â€˜Yumthangâ€™ means â€˜valley of flowersâ€™ and
                        now we can obviously understand what is this North Sikkim tour place be like. The valley is full
                        of rhododendrons and one can imagine what the scene looks like. The flowers bloom during the
                        months of March to May. The place is filled with red,pink,blue and purple flowers all blissful
                        in nature. There is a natural hot spring named as â€˜Yumthang Hot Springâ€™ and here because of the
                        presence of sulphur people can take a soothing bath and heal all their pain from their body. In
                        a chilled weather, this warm shower will be like a blessing. Near Yumthang in Sikkim, there are
                        two rivers namely, Yumthang Chu and Puniya Chu which are perfect for fishing purposes.
                        <br><br><br><br>

                        ZERO POINT: Visiting the last juncture of the Gangtok tourist spots and that is Zero point in
                        Sikkim. Now, why the name Zero Point? Well, this point is the last stop in the civilian roadway
                        and you cannot drive any further ahead. It is 23 kilometres from Yumthang with an altitude of
                        15,000 feet. Another amazing fact: China border is just a short distance away from here but we
                        are not allowed to go to a sad part. This is a surprising place indeed because as it is told if
                        you work hard you will get reward eventually and so is this place. The path is unreliable but
                        the result is very fascinating because you will get to witness three riversâ€™ amalgamation along
                        with the aerial mountains covered with snow and also some eye soothing scenes. Zero Point in
                        Sikkim place is deprived of vegetation though one can only see some stretches of grassy land
                        during the melting of snow. After the whole dayâ€™s trip, we will get back to Gangtok. The night
                        will be spent at Gangtokâ€™s hotel. <br><br>
