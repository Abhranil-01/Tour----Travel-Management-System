            Please note that the charges of Ropeway must be paid by guests directly. After that, we will return to the
            hotel and have our lunch.<br><br>

            We will visit the Tea Garden from outside. Please note that some of these venues remain closed on certain
            days of the week. But we will try to incorporate the itinerary in such a way that you will be able to see
            all of them.<br><br>

            In the evening, explore yourself, you are free to stroll around the area, and we will be staying the night
            at the Hotel in Darjeeling.<br><br>

            Kindly note that the early morning Tiger Hill visit is dependent on token availability as well. If Tiger
            hill's visit is not confirmed, we will do it in the evening time, if we can manage some
            time.<br><br><br><br>
